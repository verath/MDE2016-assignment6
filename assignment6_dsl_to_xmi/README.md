# DSL to XMI

This project contains a simple application for translating
a configurator defined by the configurator DSL into a 
configurator instance model that can be directly read 
by ecore. In other words, the application takes a 
`.configuratordsl` file and produces a `.xmi` file 
representing the same model.
