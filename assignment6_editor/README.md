# Editor

The Editor project is a stand-alone java application that
allows for selecting features from the specified configurator
instance. This is done by providing a simple console-based
interface. It also does some fairly simple validation of the
selections made, as well as allows for saving (serializing) 
the choices to a new configurator model instance.
