# Vendor

This project contains shared third party dependencies needed to work with 
the model files from a stand-alone java project.

Note that in order to keep the sice of the repository down, not all the
.jar files are included for the projects. Also note that in a "real"
project, one would probably want to manage these dependencies using some
build tool, like maven or gradle.
